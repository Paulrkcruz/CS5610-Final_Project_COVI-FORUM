### [8.0.1](https://github.com/npm/ssri/compare/v8.0.0...v8.0.1) (2021-01-27)

## [8.0.0](https://github.com/npm/ssri/compare/v7.1.0...v8.0.0) (2020-02-18)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* SRI values with `../` in the algorithm name now throw
as invalid (which they always probably should have!)
* adds a new error that will be thrown.  Empty SRIs are
no longer considered valid for checking, only when using integrityStream
to calculate the SRI value.

## [7.0.0](https://github.com/npm/ssri/compare/v6.0.1...v7.0.0) (2019-09-18)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* ssri no longer accepts a Promise option, and does not
use, return, or rely on Bluebird promises.
* drop support for Node.js v6.

We knew this was coming, and the Stream changes are breaking anyway.
May as well do this now.
* **streams:** this replaces the Node.js stream with a Minipass
stream.  See http://npm.im/minipass for documentation.
