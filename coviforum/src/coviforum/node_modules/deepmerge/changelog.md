# [4.2.2](https://github.com/TehShrike/deepmerge/releases/tag/v4.2.2)

- `isMergeableObject` is now only called if there are two values that could be merged.  [a34dd4d2](https://github.com/TehShrike/deepmerge/commit/a34dd4d25bf5e250653540a2022bc832c7b00a19)

# [4.2.1](https://github.com/TehShrike/deepmerge/releases/tag/v4.2.1)

- Fix: falsey values can now be merged.  [#170](https://github.com/TehShrike/deepmerge/issues/170)

# [4.2.0](https://github.com/TehShrike/deepmerge/releases/tag/v4.2.0)

- Properties are now only overwritten if they exist on the target object and are enumerable.  [#164](https://github.com/TehShrike/deepmerge/pull/164)

Technically this could probably be a patch release since "which properties get overwritten" wasn't documented and accidentally overwriting a built-in function or some function up the property chain would almost certainly be undesirable, but it feels like a gray area, so here we are with a feature version bump.
